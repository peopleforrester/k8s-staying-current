## 5 CNCF TAGs (Technical Advisory Groups)

Advisory groups that provide guidance on technical areas — they don't own code. Restructured from 8 to 5 in May 2025.

| TAG | Scope |
|-----|-------|
| Developer Experience | Databases, Microservices, Developer Frameworks |
| Infrastructure | Storage, Network, Compute, Service Mesh, Edge |
| Operational Resilience | Observability, Reliability, Cost, Chaos Engineering |
| Security and Compliance | Supply Chain Security, Policy, Auditing, Compliance |
| Workloads Foundation | Containers, Runtime, Serverless, Wasm, Batch, CI/CD |

Details: [`cncf-tags.md`](cncf-tags.md)

## 24 Kubernetes SIGs

SIGs own the code, tests, documentation, and roadmap for their area. They report to the Steering Committee.

Details: [`all-24-sigs.md`](all-24-sigs.md)

## Key Distinction

| | Kubernetes Governance | CNCF Governance |
|-|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Code authority** | Steering Committee → SIGs | None (advisory only) |
| **Technical oversight** | Steering Committee | TOC |
| **Budget/legal** | CNCF provides | Governing Board |
| **Advisory groups** | Working Groups | TAGs |

**Mental model:** CNCF is the landlord. Kubernetes arranges its own furniture. The CNCF provides infrastructure but doesn't tell SIGs what code to write.
