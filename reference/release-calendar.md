## Support Policy

Each release receives approximately **14 months** of total support:
- **~12 months active support** — Bug fixes and security patches
- **~2 months maintenance mode** — Only CVE fixes, dependency updates, and critical issues

Kubernetes maintains patches for the **3 most recent minor releases** (N, N-1, N-2).

### Current Support Window (as of February 2026)

| Version | Status |
|---------|--------|
| v1.35 | Active support (current) |
| v1.34 | Active support |
| v1.33 | Active support |
| v1.32 | Maintenance mode → **EOL Feb 28, 2026** |

When v1.36 ships (~April 22, 2026), v1.33 becomes the oldest supported version.
