You passed your CKA. Congratulations. Now what?

Kubernetes ships three releases a year. The version you studied for goes end-of-life in 14 months. The newsletters you bookmarked are dead. The social media accounts you followed moved platforms. And the governance structure you barely understood just reorganized.

This repository is the companion resource for our KubeCon EU 2026 talk. Every link, tool, checklist, and reference we mentioned — verified, organized, and maintained.

## The 30-Minute Weekly System

| Cadence | Time | What to Do |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Once** | 5 min | Subscribe to the Non-Negotiable Five (above) |
| **Weekly** | 20 min | Read LWKD + scan 1–2 SIG Slack channels for your role |

| **Quarterly** | 1 hr | Run pluto + kubent + review upcoming release KEPs |

### By Role

| Role | Follow These SIGs | Checklist |

## The Problem

At KodeKloud, we've trained over a million students for Kubernetes certifications. The number one message we get after someone passes: *"I passed. Now what?"*

Your certification is a snapshot. It proves you understood Kubernetes at one point in time. But Kubernetes doesn't stop moving. v1.32 went end-of-life on February 28, 2026. v1.35 shipped December 17, 2025. v1.36 is targeting April 22, 2026. If you're not actively keeping up, you're falling behind — and the gap compounds.

The good news: you don't need to spend hours every week. You need a system, the right subscriptions, and a mental model for how the ecosystem is organized.

## How Kubernetes Ships

Kubernetes follows a predictable cadence: **3 releases per year**, each on roughly a **15-week cycle**, with **14 months of patch support** after release.

| Version | Name | Release Date | EOL |
|---------|------|-------------|-----|
| v1.35 | Timbernetes | Dec 17, 2025 | Feb 2027 |
| v1.34 | Of Wind & Will | Aug 2025 | Oct 2026 |
| v1.33 | Octarine | Apr 2025 | Jun 2026 |
| v1.32 | Penelope | Dec 2024 | **Feb 28, 2026 (EOL)** |

**v1.36** code freeze: March 18, 2026. Target release: April 22, 2026.

Every release ships with a detailed blog post listing new features, deprecations, and removals. That blog post is worth more than any vendor webinar. Read it.

New features go through the **KEP (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal)** process — Alpha (off by default) → Beta (on by default) → Stable (GA). Track them at [kep.k8s.io](https://kubernetes.dev/resources/keps/) or filter release notes at [relnotes.k8s.io](https://relnotes.k8s.io).

## Who Runs Kubernetes

**Kubernetes is run by 24 Special Interest Groups (SIGs).** Each SIG owns a specific area — the code, the tests, the docs, the roadmap. The CNCF provides infrastructure (CI/CD, legal entity, conferences) but doesn't tell SIGs what to build.

| SIG | Owns | | SIG | Owns |
|-----|------|-|-----|------|
| SIG Network | All networking | | SIG Storage | PVs, CSI |
| SIG Node | The kubelet | | SIG CLI | kubectl |
| SIG Auth | RBAC, authn | | SIG Release | Release process |
| SIG Apps | Workload APIs | | SIG etcd | etcd (newest SIG) |

> Full list with Slack channels, meetings, and leads: [`reference/all-24-sigs.md`](reference/all-24-sigs.md)

**Governance at a glance:** 7-person Steering Committee · 11-person TOC · 5 CNCF TAGs · 11 Working Groups

> **SIGs vs TAGs:** SIGs own Kubernetes code and report to Steering. CNCF TAGs are advisory only and report to the TOC. They are not the same thing — the CNCF renamed theirs from "SIGs" to "TAGs" to fix the confusion.

> Details: [`reference/governance-quick-ref.md`](reference/governance-quick-ref.md) | [`reference/cncf-tags.md`](reference/cncf-tags.md) | [`reference/working-groups.md`](reference/working-groups.md)

## The 2025 Landscape Shift

If you're following guides written before 2025, many of your bookmarks are broken.

| Status | What | Details |
|--------|------|---------|
| Dead | **KubeWeekly** newsletter | Last issue #434, May 2025 |
| Dead | **"Ship It"** podcast | Rebranded to "Fork Around and Find Out" |
| Archived | Old CNCF TAG Slack channels | 8 TAGs became 5 (June 2025) |
| Uncertain | **Kubernetes Slack** | Salesforce threatened downgrade Jun 2025, then cancelled. Still active. |
| Moved | **Official social** | Bluesky is primary (@kubernetes.io). X/Twitter deprioritized. |
| New | **Wisdom of the Cloud** | Replaced KubeWeekly. Monthly. [cncf.io/newsletter](https://cncf.io/newsletter) |
| Current | **LWKD** | Still the best weekly digest. [lwkd.info](https://lwkd.info) |

## Five Things to Remember

1. **Your cert is a snapshot.** Kubernetes ships three times a year.
2. **SIGs own everything.** Follow the SIG, not the vendor blog.
3. **The information landscape changed in 2025.** Update your bookmarks.
4. **Thirty minutes a week.** That's all it takes.
5. **If you want to contribute, the path exists and it starts today.**
